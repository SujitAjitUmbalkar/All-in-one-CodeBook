# All-in-one-CodeBook

This repository contains C, C++, Java, and Python programs organized in a step-by-step sequence.
It starts from basic programming concepts like syntax, loops, and functions, and gradually moves to advanced topics such as data structures, algorithms, and multithreading.

This project is my personal coding journal — a way to document my learning, practice problem-solving, and build a strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).
Many problems are written in multiple steps to show how a solution evolves (basic → optimized → edge cases).

📚 Topics Covered
✅ Basics: Syntax, I/O, Loops, Functions
✅ Arrays, Strings & Matrices
✅ Object-Oriented Programming (Java, C++)
✅ File Handling & Input/Output Operations
✅ Data Structures (Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs)
✅ Algorithms (Searching, Sorting, Recursion, DP, Greedy)
✅ Multithreading & Concurrency (Java)
✅ Miscellaneous Practice Problems & Pattern Printing

🎯 Purpose
This repository is designed to:

Help me track my learning journey step by step

Provide a quick way to revise concepts anytime

Practice clean code and multiple approaches for problem-solving

Build consistency and confidence in programming

▶️ How to Run Programs

C
gcc program.c -o prog
./prog

C++
g++ program.cpp -o prog
./prog

Java
javac Program.java
java Program

Python
python3 program.py


📝 Note
This repo is mainly for self-learning and practice.
Anyone is welcome to explore it, but it may not always follow production-level coding conventions — it is focused on clarity and learning rather than performance tuning.
