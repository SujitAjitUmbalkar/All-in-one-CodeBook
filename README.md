# Logic-Building Codebook  

This repository contains **C, C++, Java, and Python programs** organized in a **step-by-step sequence**.  
It starts from **basic programming concepts** like syntax, loops, and functions, and gradually moves to **advanced topics** such as data structures, algorithms, and multithreading.  

This project is my **personal coding journal** ‚Äî a way to document my learning, practice problem-solving, and build a strong foundation in **DSA and logic building**.  
Many problems are written in multiple steps to show how a solution evolves (**basic ‚Üí optimized ‚Üí edge cases**).
